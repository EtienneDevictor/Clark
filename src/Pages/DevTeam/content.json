    "paragraph1": "SCEâ€™s development team works on a variety of projects by exposing students to technology not taught in classrooms, but extremely relevant to the industry. The development team is exposed to tools and technologies such as React, MongoDB, Docker, Nginx, and more. With the use of various hardware elements, team members learn about parts of the hardware development process such as initial circuit design, hardware interfacing, firmware design, and other disciplines.",
    "paragraph2": "The development team exposes students to a replica of the workforce by encouraging members to foster an environment that encourages teamwork, strong communication skills, and innovation. Due to the experience that development team members are exposed to, team members have landed internships at places including but not limited to Microsoft, Google, Meta, VMWare, Amazon, and more.",
    "paragraph3": "In 2020, we started our first annual SCE internship to provide our members the opportunity to gain industry-level experience and develop their technical skills. We recruited a small team of individuals after a selective interview process to partake in a 10-week project alongside alumni mentors. Our projects consist of advanced tools and technologies that teach our interns relevant tech stacks that are used in the industry. Our previous interns have gone on to work at top companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, Lyft, LinkedIn, and more. Our internship is completely unpaid and on a voluntary basis."
